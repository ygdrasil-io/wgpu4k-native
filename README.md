This project is a WebGPU binding compatible with Desktop and Mobile. If you are looking for an experience that also covers the web, you can use the [wgpu4k](https://github.com/wgpu4k/wgpu4k) project.

This library uses the Firefox backend written in Rust, [available here](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native).

Check the [demo folder](https://github.com/wgpu4k/wgpu4k-native/tree/main/demo) to see how to use the library.
